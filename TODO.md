# TODO

Here you can find the current TODOs for the project. The TODOs are approximately listed by priority.

Each TODO is somewhat abstract and may require a lot of work to implement.

- Improve the performance of the capture provider. Current performance is very bad, especially when capturing large windows/displays.
- Figure out and implement the networking structure to send and receive the captured frames.
- Overhaul UI to display the networked frames and the perhaps also the local preview.
- Contacts system for easily setting up screen sharing.
